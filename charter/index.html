				<h2>Scope</h2>
				<ul>
					<li>Continue development of existing ARIA specifications to address needs reported by authors and to to achieve parity with native host languages, creating new ARIA specifications where necessary;</li>
					<li>For each ARIA specification developed by this Working Group, create a corresponding Accessibility API Mappings specification defining the correct exposure for each platform;</li>
					<li>For all attributes defined by this Working Group, document best practices for authors;</li>
					<li>Collaborate with other groups to create mapping specifications for native host language semantics;</li>
					<li>Develop testing tools which can be used to verify accessibility implementations by examining the mappings exposed via platform accessibility APIs;</li>
					<li>Collaborate with other groups involved in defining ARIA techniques and implementing ARIA support.</li>
				</ul>
				<div id="section-out-of-scope">
					<h3 id="out-of-scope">Out of Scope</h3>
					<p>The following features are out of scope, and will not be addressed by this Working Group:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Technologies for which corresponding Accessibility API Mappings do not need to be defined.</li>
					</ul>
				</div>
				<div>
					<h3>Success Criteria</h3>
					<p>The normative documents produced by this Working Group fall into two categories: ARIA specifications and Accessibility API Mapping specifications.</p>
					<ul>
						<li>For ARIA specifications, implementability and interoperability will be demonstrated by having at least two independent implementations of each of feature defined in that specification.</li>
						<li>For every platform with mappings in an Accessibility API Mapping specification, at least one implementation of 75% of the mappings being tested on that platform will demonstrate implementability on that platform. Multiple implementations of each platform are not required because some platforms have only one implementation. For features that are not platform-specific, passing test results in at least two different implementations will be documented to demonstrate implementability.</li>
					</ul>
					<p> Modules that reach <a href="https://www.w3.org/2018/Process-20180201/#rec-publication">W3C Recommendation</a>, are considered successful when all of the following are present:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Production of stable documents addressing the work items listed in the Deliverables section.</li>
						<li>Test suites for each module with conformance criteria.</li>
						<li>Availability of multiple, independent, interoperable implementations of each feature with conformance criteria in each deliverable; as demonstrated by an implementation report (summarizing implementation status against the relevant test suite) for each testable class of product, including user agents.</li>
						<li>Deployment on multiple platforms.</li>
						<li>User community and industry adoption of the group deliverables.</li>
					</ul>

			<section id="deliverables">
				<h2> Deliverables </h2>
				<p>In order to maximize the likelihood of achieving the success criteria described above, the ARIA Working Group will follow a <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/workflow">work flow</a> designed to see each feature from its <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/roadmap">road map</a> through to completion, with ARIA feature development, platform accessibility API mapping, implementation, <a href="https://github.com/w3c/testing-how-to/#test-as-you-commit-pointer-event-whatwg-webperf">testing</a>, and authoring guidance taking place at the same time.</p>
				<p><i>Draft state</i> indicates the state of the deliverable at the time of the charter approval. <i>Expected completion</i> indicates when the deliverable is projected to become a Recommendation, or otherwise reach a stable state.</p>
				<div id="normative">
					<h3> Normative Specifications </h3>
					<p>The Working Group develops two classes of specifications: Accessible Rich Internet Applications (ARIA) modules (which include the core ARIA specification), and Accessibility API Mappings (AAMs). ARIA modules define roles, states, and properties, to clarify the accessibility semantics of the element on which they are used. Roles are used in content as values of the role attribute, while states and properties are used in content as attributes whose name begins with the prefix "aria-". Accessibility API Mappings define how these features are exposed by user agents to accessibility APIs, which vary by platform, in order to ensure a consistent user experience across the Web. The Working Group will release versions of ARIA and AAM on a cyclical basis, and expects to produce multiple versions during the charter period. The Working Group may undertake additional modules that fit the definitions above to keep the ARIA technology complete and well organized. At charter time, this work includes: </p>

						<dd>
							<p>Accessible Rich Internet Applications (WAI-ARIA) provides an ontology of roles, states, and properties that define accessible user interface elements and can be used to improve the accessibility and interoperability of web content and applications. These semantics are designed to allow an author to properly convey user interface behaviors and structural information to assistive technologies in document-level markup.</p>

						<dd>
							<p>The Accessible Name and Description Computation specification describes how user agents determine the names and descriptions of accessible objects from web content languages. This information is in turn exposed through accessibility APIs so that assistive technologies can identify these objects and present their names or descriptions to users. Documenting the algorithm through which names and descriptions are to be determined promotes interoperable exposure of these properties among different accessibility APIs and helps to ensure that this information appears in a manner consistent with author intent.</p>
							<p>This specification defines support that applies across multiple content technologies. This includes accessible name and description provided by general-purpose WAI-ARIA roles, states, and properties as well as features specific to individual content languages.</p>

						<dd>
							<p>The Core Accessibility API Mappings specification describes how user agents should expose semantics of web content languages to accessibility APIs. This helps users with disabilities to obtain and interact with information using assistive technologies. Documenting these mappings promotes interoperable exposure of roles, states, properties, and events implemented by accessibility APIs and helps to ensure that this information appears in a manner consistent with author intent.</p>
							<p>This specification defines support that applies across multiple content technologies, including general keyboard navigation support and mapping of general-purpose roles, states, and properties provided in Web content via WAI-ARIA. Other Accessibility API Mappings specifications depend on and extend this Core specification for specific technologies, including native technology features and WAI-ARIA extensions.</p>

						<dt id="dpub-aam" class="spec"><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/dpub-aam/">Digital Publishing Accessibility API Mappings</a></dt>
						<dd>
							<p>This specification defines how user agents map the Digital Publishing WAI-ARIA Module markup to platform accessibility APIs. It is intended for user agent developers responsible for accessibility in their user agent so that they can support the accessibility content produced for digital publishing.</p>
							<p>The implementation of this specification in user agents enables authors to produce more accessible digital publications, by conveying structural book constructs used by the digital publishing industry to assistive technologies. It does this by extending the Core Accessibility API Mappings and the Accessible Name and Description Computation specifications for user agents. It provides Accessibility API Mapping guidance for the roles defined in the Digital Publish WAI-ARIA Module.</p>
							<p>N.B. The work to be done on this deliverable will depend on the plans of the Publishing Working Group, which develops and maintains the Digital Publishing WAI-ARIA Module. At the time of this writing, those plans remain unsettled. See <a href="https://www.w3.org/blog/dpub/2018/03/06/publishing-wg-telco-2018-03-05-dpub-aria-extensions-epub-3-2/">this status update</a> for more information.</p>
